I am a third-year undergraduate from the [Zhi-Class](https://zhi-class.ai/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 
My current research focuses on robot learning, specifically **real-world reinforcement learning** and **robotic manipulation**.

I'm currently conducting research at [PKU-Agibot Lab](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/researchlabs/237027.htm), 
advised by Prof. [Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io). 
Before that, I am honored to work at [STRUCT](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/), 
advised by Prof. [Jiaying Liu](http://39.96.165.147/people/liujiaying.html).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
